  "HelpSettlementContent": "The result is settled automatically at the end of the countdown period. The final answer at that time is the winner and claims the bond and the reward, if any.

  "HelpArbitration": "Arbitration",
  "HelpArbitrationContent": "Anyone who wants to challenge the final answer can request arbitration. The arbitrator can be any Ethereum contract and may be controlled by a company, a trusted group or individual, a DAO, or any other decision-making process you can code. The arbitrator contract will have a set fee that must be paid to settle the question, but if the winning total is high enough, it can be profitable to challenge an answer via arbitration.",
